# Automating environment setup with AppleScript
Some part of my job is maintaining half-dead applications that are still relevant to the business, but other teams have
already started working on their replacements. This means, I want to keep the effort to maintain these applications
minimal. Handling incoming support requests from our users is the main work I do on these applications, so the less time
I have to spend on anything not solving the users issue, the better for the user, the organisation, and me.

* raycast commands/scripts
  * does it also work for standard mac command window?
* apple script to execute terminal
  * set environment variables

```bash
script bla bla
```
